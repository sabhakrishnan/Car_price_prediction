# Car_price_prediction
Non-Linear Model
This is a car sales data set which is taken from Analytixlabs. This is a continuous data set which include several predictors.From this data set we have to predict car sales by using machine learning Techniques.
So lets work on this dataset together and carry out which machine learning technique is best suited for prediction.
I am using Python language you can use any language for this .So go for it and enjoy.
If you have any query related data you can freely post your query
